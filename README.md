# Rocket Motor Test System
RMTS is a complete set of test stand electronics in a single board for amateur motor builders. It was designed to be a simple and safe way to ignite solid rocket motors and collect data from their firing to enable hobbyists to make informed decisions as they iterate on their propellant formulas and motor designs. It is similar in complexity to a standard rocketry altimeter and doesn't require any special skills to use. It is a standalone unit meaning you don't need to leave a computer near the motor. As it is specialized for rocketry, it displays thrust and pressure curves immediately after the firing without needing to pass the data through a spreadsheet. The built in wireless ignition channel reduces the number of devices you need to set up to one and allows you to measure the motor's startup transient as logging begins when the igniter fires.
## Components
The system consists of a transmitter, receiver, and an application that is run on the user's computer. The transmitter is the larger of the two circuit boards included in the system and has terminal blocks around the edge for connecting transducers and the igniter. The receiver is the smaller board and has two connectors, one USB port for connecting to the user's computer and an RP-SMA jack for the antenna. The software can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/reilleya/RMTS-Software/releases).
## Using RMTS
Before using RMTS for the first time you will need to calibrate it. More information about what that entails it found [here](reilley.net).
To assemble and use the system for a series of static fires, follow [this](reilley.net) guide.
